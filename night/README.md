Acceleator Program Alumni Companies  - FedTech
===================

For this project I was tasked with creating an interactive data visualization. This interface uses dynamic elements to show more 
information than can be presented in a single view. The FedTech Accelerator program alumni companies are mapped out in a geographic mercator map, and can be zoomed in on and hovered over for more detailed information. Additionally, a few other supporting visualizations were made to present other metrics about alumni cohorts!
